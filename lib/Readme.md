# This is an implementation of the kata08 (http://codekata.com/kata/kata08-conflicting-objectives/)

## Note:
I solved the kata08 (by Dave Thomas) thinking about the readability of the code, in fact at the end was readable but really slow.
To easily improve the performance I used the Set data structure instead of simple array to check the inclusion of the words (see Combiner class). Now it is very fast too.

## How to run it:

`ruby find_words.rb`

## How to run the tests:

`bundle`

`rspec`
